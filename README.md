# ALU System Engineering DevOps

This repository contains various configurations and scripts for managing system engineering and DevOps tasks. The main focus areas include firewall settings, load balancers, SSH configuration, web server setup, and web stack debugging across different levels.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `firewall/`
This directory contains configurations related to setting up and managing firewall rules. The firewall is crucial for securing the system by controlling the inbound and outbound traffic.

- **Purpose**: System security through controlled access.
- **Files**: Likely includes firewall rule scripts, configurations, or related documentation.

### 2. `load_balancer/`
This folder holds the configuration and implementation files for setting up a load balancer. Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overloaded, improving system reliability and scalability.

- **Purpose**: To distribute network or application traffic across several servers.
- **Files**: Contains load balancer configuration scripts.

### 3. `ssh/`
This directory is dedicated to SSH (Secure Shell) configurations. SSH is used to securely connect to remote systems and transfer data.

- **Purpose**: Secure remote access and file transfer between systems.
- **Files**: Includes configuration files for SSH access.

### 4. `web_server/`
This folder is concerned with the setup, configuration, and management of web servers. Web servers serve HTTP requests and host websites or web applications.

- **Purpose**: Host web services and applications.
- **Files**: Likely includes web server configuration files (e.g., NGINX, Apache).

### 5. `web_stack_debugging_{0-4}/`
These directories contain scripts and resources for debugging issues within the web stack at different levels. Each level represents various stages of debugging, helping to resolve issues related to the system's web infrastructure.

- **Purpose**: Debugging issues with the web stack.
- **Files**: Logs, scripts, and configurations used for diagnosing and fixing web-related issues.

## How to Use

1. **Firewall Configuration**: 
   - Navigate to the `firewall/` directory to modify or apply firewall rules. Ensure that you are familiar with firewall management tools (e.g., `ufw` or `iptables`).

2. **Load Balancer**:
   - Load balancer configurations can be found under the `load_balancer/` folder. Modify these to fit your server's architecture and requirements for distributing traffic.

3. **SSH Setup**:
   - To configure SSH access, go to the `ssh/` directory. Ensure the necessary keys and permissions are set correctly for secure connections.

4. **Web Server Setup**:
   - Check the `web_server/` folder for configuration files related to web server setups like NGINX or Apache. Follow the instructions provided within each file to set up the server properly.

5. **Web Stack Debugging**:
   - If you encounter any issues with the web stack, the `web_stack_debugging_{0-4}/` directories provide resources to help you debug the system.
